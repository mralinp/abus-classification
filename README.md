# ABUS Classification

Classification of human breast cancer lesions on 3D-ABUS. This project is under supervision of Iran Image Processing Lab (Iran-IPL). Using the source codes has no restrictions under MIT licence but using datasets are private and only accessible under lab conditions. for more information please contact support@tasvirpardazi.com.

# Build/Run

Before you get started please make sure that all the requirments are installed properly:

- Anaconda

> Note: For gpu support follow the instructions here: [instaling tf with gpu support](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip)

Then create and activate a virtual environment for the project:

```bash
$ conda create --name abus-classification --python=3.9
$ conda activate abus-classification
```

And installed project requirments:
```bash
(venv) $ python -m pip install -t requirements.txt 
```

## Windows (Comming soon...)
